# TRexGame
My attempt on coding googles TRexgame

# ATTENTION!
If you wat to play it, you have to download TRexGame.jar and TRexGame.png AND put them in the SAME directory. otherwise the game wont start.

Feel free to beat my Highscore of 4415. It can be hard at the beginning, but its doable.
If you beat my highscore, post it on twitter (and tag me with @JOKUE2002) or in this repository (create an issue) (JOKUE2002/TRexGame)

Enjoy!
